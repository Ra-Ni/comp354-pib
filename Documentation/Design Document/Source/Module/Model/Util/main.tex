\subsubsection{Package Util}

The Util subsystem contains the Verbose class, which handles the models logging. Any logs generated by the model are sent to the Verbose class, which is a subject in the Observer design pattern. The Verbose class is a singleton, and when the Verbose objects log() method is called, it alerts any of its Observers to a change in its state, and allows them to retrieve the message being logged, in accordance with the Observer pattern.
