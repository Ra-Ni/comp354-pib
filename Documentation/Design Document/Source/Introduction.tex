\section{INTRODUCTION}

The purpose of this project is to use software engineering practices to develop a desktop application which plays the Codenames game with NPC's of varying "intelligence." The software was designed using MVC architecture and several common design patterns including the "Strategy Pattern," "Observer Pattern," and "Command Pattern."

This document provides an explanation of our application's architectural and class level software design. The Architectural Design section gives a high level look at how the system is organized using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The Detailed Design section describes the design within the subsystems and the purposes of each class. The Dynamic Design Scenarios section explains how the application works by explaining significant execution scenarios of the system.
