\section{System}

\subsection{Purpose}
Develop a working computer game based on the table top card game Codenames.
\subsection{Context}
The game is written in Java using the Java FX framework and will run as a desktop application. This will be a single user experience with only the person at the machine interacting with the device will be the user. The rest will be ran by the system.
\subsection{Business Goals}
To make a free and enjoyable experience with a quality user interface.
\section{Domain Concepts}
The domain we are working in is of the table top board game genre.\\
Therefore we are working with the concepts of cards, players, turns, a winner and a loser.\\
The games basis is to start with a board with a 5x5 grid of cards with nouns on them. The SpyMasters have a matching card that acts as the key cards showing the words they want their given operatives to pick. The SpyMaster does that by giving a hint consisting of a single noun and a number. The Operative then has that many guesses to find the hint that the SpyMaster has given per round. The SpyMaster places down the appropriate card for the given guess, if it is a bystander or the other team's colour it ends the turn, if it is the assassin it is game over and the other team wins, if it is all of the colours that given team wins when they are out of their colour. This game is played until the assassin is struck or all the colours are chosen for any given team.

\subsection{Board}
The board represents the layout of the game. The board setup consists of 25 cards, placed in a 5 x 5 grid. The entire game revolves around the board. A word is written on each card that makes up the board. This word represents the Code name that the operatives from each team has to guess. Once the game starts, all the different types of cards that the Spy Masters hold must be placed on top of the appropriate card on the 5 x 5 board. 

Each card belongs to a team. 

\newpage

\subsection{Cards}
Description of all different types of cards

\subsubsection{Key Card}
The Key Card is the initial card that is picked by the Spy Masters. This card determines which team starts: red or blue team. It also shows the spy masters a map of the board and specifies which cards belong to the blue team, which cards belong to the red team, which cards are bystanders, and which card is the assassin. The team that starts the game always has one extra card on the board.

\subsubsection{Blue Cards}
There are 9 Blue cards in total in the game. These are placed on the board every time a card that belongs to the blue team has been guessed. If the blue team starts the game, 9 blue cards will be placed on the board in total. If the blue team is second (does not start the game), only 8 blue cards will be placed on the board in total

\subsubsection{Red Cards}
There are 9 Red cards in total in the game. These are placed on the board every time a card that belongs to the Red team has been guessed. If the Red team starts the game, 9 Red cards will be placed on the board in total. If the Red team is second (does not start the game), only 8 Red cards will be placed on the board in total

\subsubsection{Bystander Cards}
There are 7 Bystander Cards in the game. If a team guesses the Code name of a bystander, their turn terminates and the opposite team can retaliate. 

\subsubsection{Assassin Card}
There is one assassin card in the game. Each map card specifies which Code name on the board is the assassin. in order to win a game, the assassin card should not be guessed. As soon as the assassin card is guessed, the game terminates and the opposite team wins.

\newpage

\subsection{Clues}
Description of a legal clue. \newline
Clues are given by the Spymasters to the Operatives so they can start guessing. Several rules determine if a clue is legal. These rules are:
Each clue consists on exactly one word and one number. The word is a hint that is related to one or more code names on the board. the number represents tells the operatives how many instances on the board are related to the word in the clue. \newline
The words in the clues cannot rhyme with their associated code name on the board, nor can it be a synonym or a description of the word. \newline
If the number giver in the clue is zero or infinity, this means that the operatives have an unlimited number of guesses. However, once they guess a wrong card from the board, their turn terminates.\newline

\subsection{Spy Masters}
Description of Spy Masters role\newline
Spy Masters are the one that start the game. 
Spy masters are not allowed to do anything else other than give a clue that consists of one word and one number.

\subsection{Operatives}
Description of Operatives role\newline
Each game can have one or more operatives. Operatives have to guess which card the board the clues belong to. If they guess the wrong card, they can save the guess for a later turn.
