Completed the basic GUI look. While writing the code, I realized that the object Text could be used in Model, and read by the Viewer when it is constructed to avoid having the Model-View interaction overhead. The GUI would automatically update itself whenever the model changes the Text object using the setText() method. This is part of javafx library, may be useful to look into while developing the Card/Manager in Model.
